*Flash Point: Fire Rescue*
# Dangerous Terrain

## Materials
  - Game board: `./printables`
  - Brush Markers: `./printables`
  - Wind die (D4)
  - Wind Marker: `./printables`
  - Controlled Burn Markers: `./printables`

## Setup

Follow the normal game setup with the following exceptions:

1. Roll and place Brush Markers instead of Hazmat Markers
    * Recruit - 4 Brush
    * Veteran - 5 Brush
    * Heroic - 6 Brush
2. Roll and place the Wind Marker to determine the starting direction of the Wind
3. All Firefighters and the Helicopter start at Base Camp.

## Base Camp
All parts of the forest are not equally accessible when a forest fire begins burning.

- The Helicopter must start in Base Camp
- Firefighters must start in Base Camp
- Firefighters may return to Base Camp or the Helicopter when Knocked Down
- Victims are not rescued until they are returned to Base Camp for treatment

Base Camp can be damaged by Fire during and Explosion. If Base Camp takes 4 damage cube it is lost and the Firefighters lose the game. Damage cannot be removed from Base Camp.

## Trees
Trees fill the forest and are indicated on the board with green borders.  Trees function like like walls and therefore cannot be walked through (unless destroyed) and may receive damage tokens as a result of an Explosion.

*Note: The Structural Engineer cannot remove damage tokens from Trees.*

## Wind
As the wind blows, it affects the spread of Fire as it can change direction at any time.  During the Advance Fire roll, include the wind die. Before resolving the Advance Fire action, rotate the wind marker to reflect the new direction:
1. North
2. East
3. South
4. West

The Wind affects the following actions:
- **Extinguish** 
  - Firefighters cannot Extinguish Smoke or Fire if downwind
  - An adjacent upwind token is also extinguished for no additional AP

- **Fly / Air Attack**
  - The Helicopter cannot Fly or perform an Air Attack if downwind

## Brush
Brush is the dry vegetation in the forest that can ignite and spread quickly. When Smoke or Fire is added to a square with a brush marker the Brush immediately ignites. Replace the Brush Marker with a Fire Marker and add a Hotspot to the square.

Additionally, the Brush sparks and causes the Fire to spread downwind.  Add an additional Fire Marker downwind of the original square containing the Brush.  If a Fire Marker cannot be added due to trees, add 1 Damage marker instead.

If a brush fire sparks an Explosion resolve it normally.

## Helicopter
The Helicopter can fight fire from the air and transport both Firefighters and Victims between landing locations. Firefighters can perform the Change Role action when at the same location as the Helicopter and may also return to the Helicopter if Knocked Down.

Firefighters may use the Helicopter to perform the following actions:

- **Fly - Fly the Helicopter to any landing area (Drive Action):** 2 AP, 1AP if flying with the Wind
  
  A Firefighter may Fly the Helicopter to *any* landing location on the board; it cannot be called by radio.  The Helicopter has room for 2 Passengers (Firefighters or Victims) to Ride along for 0AP.

- **Air Attack - Drop water from the Helicopter (Deck Gun Action)**: 4 AP, 2AP for the Driver/Operator

  The Helicopter can target the quadrant adjacent to its current landing area (denoted by the dashed red line) for an Air Attack. An Air Attack follows the same rolling rules as the Deck Gun Action.

*Note: if the Helicopter is downwind it is grounded and cannot be operated until the Wind changes direction.*

*Note: the Helicopter must always be piloted by a Firefighter to perform an action.*

## The River
In addition to limiting the access of Firefighters to the forest, the River puts POI in additional danger.

- **The River Current**
  The river current is fast can quickly move Firefighers, Victims and and POI downstream toward the waterfall.
  - After each Advance Fire phase, move any Firefighters, Victims and POI in the river 1 space downstream toward the waterfall
    - If a Firefighter goes over the waterfall, they are Knocked Down and must return to Base Camp, ending their turn immediately.  If a POI or Victim goes over the waterfall they are lost.
  - When rolling to place POI, a river square is a valid placement;  The POI is now caught in the river current!

The River has the following affects:
 - **Move action**
   - Firefighters can move into river squares for 2 AP
   - Firefighters can cross at the bridge at the normal movement cost
   - Firefighters can not Carry victims through the river, but they can Lead them through for 2 AP

- **Advance Fire**
  - Do not place a Smoke token on a river space.  Instead follow the arrows to determine where to place the token.
  - If a square adjacent to the river explodes or is the last burning square in a Shockwave, do not place a Fire token in the river.  If, however, the wind is blowing in that direction, the Fire jumps the river; place a Fire token on the square across the river.

## The Bridge
  There is a Bridge across the middle of the river by which Firefighters can cross at normal move costs.  If at any time a Fire marker should be placed on the Bridge (by Advancing Fire or Explosion) instead place a Damage marker on the Bridge.  Once the bridge has three (3) damage markers it falls and can no longer be used for safe passage.
  - The Structural Engineer may repair the Bridge at normal cost.


## Forest Firefighter - 4AP

A new Firefighter that specializes in forest fire containment.  In addition to the standard actions, the Forest Firefighter can perform the following actions.

- **Controlled Burn - Start controlled burn:** 2 AP

  Place 3 Controlled Burn markers fire-side up on your current square as long as there is no adjacent Fire. If there are not enough Controlled Burn markers you may not take this action.

  After resolving each Advance Fire action, remove the top Controlled Burn marker and return it to the Forest Firefighter.  If it is the last marker, do not remove it, but flip over to the charred side.  A square with a Charred marker can no longer receive a Smoke or Fire marker for the remainder of the game.  During an Explosion, the Shockwave is stopped by the Charred marker without adding any Fire or Damage.

  While burning, a Controlled Burn Marker acts like a standard Fire Marker when Advancing Fire. If a Controlled Burn ever causes an Explosion, resolve the Explosion as normal and remove the Controlled Burn markers from the game, replacing with a standard Fire marker.
